chilling brother (dead): dear brother, i got the tool we needed to get the hot spring to spring again...
chilling brother (dead): it's a torch.
chilling brother (dead): i'm too tired to get back to you, i think i'll just go to [wave amp=50.0 freq=5.0 connected=1]sleep forever.[/wave]
chilling brother (dead): sorry, i hope you're not bathing anymore...
chilling brother (dead): ps: the torch should be close to my corpse.
